      ><b><center>Why is Rock Paper Scissors played?</center></b><br />
      This game is played by children and adults and is popular all over the
      world. Apart from being a game played to pass time, the game is usually
      played in situations where something has to be chosen. It is similar in
      that way to other games like flipping the coin, throwing dice or drawing
      straws. There is no room for cheating or for knowing what the other person
      is going to do so the results are usually very satisfying with no room for
      fighting or error.<br /><br />
